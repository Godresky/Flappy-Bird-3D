# Flappy-Bird-3D
My attempt to replicate the Flappy Bird game, but in 3D. The game was created on the Unity 2022.3.7f1 engine, and I created the models myself using MagicaVoxel

If you want to run it through Unity, use version 2022.3.7f1.

If you want to play the game itself, use the latest release.

Rules of the game:
- Space - to jump
- Do not crash into the pipes
- Hold on as long as possible
